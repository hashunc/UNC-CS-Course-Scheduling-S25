# UNC COMP Course Scheduler

The UNC COMP Course Scheduler is an application that provides our client, Professor Montek Singh, an interface that generates a course schedule for the UNC Computer Science department based on the constraints that Professor Singh inputs. This application was possible by using JavaScript, HTML, CSS, the PuLP Linear Optimization library, and a SQLite3 based database.

## Pages

This application consists of the following pages:

1. **Login Page**: A simple way for Professor Singh to input the password to access the website.
2. **Home Page**: A page for Professor Singh to choose whether he wants to view the schedule that the algorithm has generated, edit the constraints such as professor's individual availabilities, course occupancy, room occupancies, etc. for the algorithm to run on, or manually edit the timigs and locations of certain classes.
3. **View Page**: A page where Professor Singh can choose whether he wants to view the schedule in a list view or calendar view.
4. **List View Page**: A page where Professor Singh can view the list of scheduled courses that the algorithm generated / Professor Singh manually adjusted in a tabular format.
5. **Edit Fields Page**: A page where Professor Singh can select whether he wants to update the properties for certain professors, courses, or rooms.
6. **Professors Edit Page**: A page where Professor Singh can edit the properties of each individual Computer Science department professor such as their qualified courses to teach, their availability, and the maximum number of classes they want to teach.
7. **Professors Edit Page**: A page where Professor Singh can edit the properties of each individual Computer Science course such as their sections and each section's maximum capacity.
8. **Rooms Edit Page**: A page where Professor Singh can edit the properties of each individual room in Sitterson/Fred Brooks or any university room such as their name and the room's occupancy.
9. **Update Schedule Page**: A page where Professor Singh can choose whether he wants to edit the course schedule in a list format or a calendar format.
10. **Update List View**: A page where Professor Singh can adjust the scheduling of courses manually in a list view.

## Data Definitions
We stored all our data in a Sqlite3 database. We created 7 databases to appropriately handle all the necessary data that we needed to run and edit our algorithm. We have included the database schemas below: 

CourseSchedule:
- Course: str
- Section: int
- Title: str
- Prof: str
- Start: str
- MeetingPattern: str
- SeatCapcity: int
- Room: str
- Type:str


Availability:
- Prof: str
- AvailableMP: str
- AvailablePeriod: int

ClassPeriod:
- MeetingPattern: str
- Number: int
- StartTime: str
- Duration: int

CourseSchedule:
- Course: str
- Title: str
- Section: int
- SeatCapacity: str

MaxCourses
- Prof: str
- MaxCourses: int


QualifiedCourses:
- Course: str
- Section: int


Rooms:
- Room: str
- SeatCapacity: int

We passed in serialized versions of this data as professor, course, and room data dictionaries. For our course dictionaries each individual dictionaries stored the course title, and list of section numbers and respective section capacities. For our professor dictionaries we stored qualified courses, the list of available class periods, and the max number of classes of professor wants to teach. For our room dictionaries we stored room name and capacities. The algorithm handles these dictionaries to formulate an appropriate schedule.  


## Design Rationale

There are a variety of decisions that we made in order to create this software in accordance with Professor Singh's requirements.

One of the major decisions came down to how we wanted to store our data in our SQLite database. Structuring this data was cruicial as retrieving the data and serializing the data needed to be handled properly in order to pass in the parameters into the algorithm to maintain some level of efficiency and accuracy. We decided to split the data among 7 tables so split the data for their specific purposes. This made writing the endpoints for getting, deleting, and adding data to be much simpler.

Another major decision we had to make was how to structure our objective function to provide an ideal schedule for Professor Singh. We ended up deciding to adjust our objective function such that it penalizes courses that are scheduled in the middle of the day, which we labelled as a "rush hour" penalty.

Lastly, another major decision we had to make was how to prioritize our feature development in the final project. We originally had plans to implement a calendar view for updating a course's schedule, similar to Google Calendar. However, we ran into many technical difficulties and it became tedious to debug. Seeing this, we decided to keep this component off to the side in order to have the important functionalities completed. We are still able to update and view the courses, however it is just in a tabular format as of now as opposed to a calendar view.
